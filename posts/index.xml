&lt;br/>&lt;br>
As you migh know the main langauge to write an Ethereum smart contract is Solidity so we&amp;rsquo;re gonna use Solidity.&lt;br>
&lt;br/>&lt;br>

&lt;br/>&lt;br>
note that the payment should be stored in database off-chain, otherwise we cannot track what happened to the transaction.&lt;br>
&lt;br/>&lt;br>
now let&amp;rsquo;s dive in what happens on-chain, how should we control the flow.&lt;br>

As you might know, Iran is located in the Middle East, and we speak Persian.&lt;br>
&lt;br/>&lt;br>
I have a confession to make; being and becoming a developer in Iran isnâ€™t easy; there are numerous obstacles in the way.&lt;br>
&lt;br/>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-early-stages-introduction-to-programming">The Early Stages: Introduction to Programming&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was introduced to programming by one of my relatives who worked as a network administrator at BMI (Bank Melli Iran). Before that, when I was in primary school, one of our teachers taught us how to change operating systems and introduced us to various hardware components in a PC. In 2014, during my first year of junior high school (In Iran, the education system follows K-12), I wrote my first line of code.&lt;br>
&lt;br/>&lt;br>
And thus, my journey began.&lt;br>
